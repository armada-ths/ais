The Banquet app is responsible for everything banquet related.

Banquet is the annual Armada event, where students from Armada get to meet and hangout with company represetatives in a formal party.

This includes the models for banquet tables, attendants and related forms and views in ais.armada.nu/fair/$YEAR/banquet/* urls.

An important note is that the seating algorithm is stored elsewhere at the moment of writing this document.
