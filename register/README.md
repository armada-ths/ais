The Register app is used by companies to sign up (register) for the upcoming fair.

The primary use for this app is the ais.armada.nu/register/ page, so called "complete registration". This is where the company representatives must fill in all the information that is used by Armada, like where they want to be exhibiting, contact info or transportation info.
