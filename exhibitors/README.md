The Exhibitors app is responsible for creating, managing and shoing information about exhibitors.

Exhibitors are representative enteties associated with a company for any specific fair. It can be thought of as a single representative, however it is not always the case.

This is the app responsible for ais.armada.nu/fairs/$YEAR/exhibitors/*

The most important part of this app is the Exhibitor model and form. These are used to store all necessary data about an exhibitor, like the company they represent, where during the Armada they want to place, if they were accepted, used transportation from and to the fair and so on. These are used extensively by the Sales team.
