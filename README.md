==================================================

Contribution Guides
--------------------------------------
- Please try to write clean, readable code
- Please try to write tests for your code
- Please try to write meaningful commit messages, PR descriptions etc.

Above all, be respectful towards others :)

Branching strategy
--------------------------------------
We have one long-running branch, `master`, that is more or less continuously deployed. In order to be merged into `master` your code **must** be peer reviewed by someone else on the team in a PR (this is enforced on GitHub).

Development setup
-------------
1. Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
2. Clone the repo and run `vagrant up` from the repo's root
3. ☕️
4. Browse to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and log in with username "admin" and password "admin"
5. Bam! That's your local AIS environment.

If you don't want to use Vagrant, instructions for getting started with [OSX](docs/getting_started_mac.md), [Ubuntu](docs/getting_started_linux.md), and [Windows](docs/getting_started_windows.md) are available. See [docs/producton_setup.md](docs/production_setup.md) for details on how to get a production server up and running.
