The Events app is responsible for creating, providing information, listing and registering for events.

An Event can be organized by Armada, a company represented at the fair or a group related to Armada (for example students working in Armada).

All views accessed via ais.armada.nu/fairs/$YEAR/events/* as well as ais.armada.nu/fairs/$YEAR/ default view are stored in this app.

This application is responsible for both creating events and registering for them.
