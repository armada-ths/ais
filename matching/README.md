The Matching app is responsible for student matching.

It is responsible for the related models and the matching algorithm. The matching process involves a lot of communication between the server and the mobile applications and uses API app.

The matching process can be summarised like this:

* The mobile application fetches dynamic data for the matching from the server.
* User provides their input.
* The mobile application sends that input to the server. This starts the matching algorithm for that user.
* The matching algorithm runs and creats matching results.
* The mobile application fetches the matching result from the server.
