class StudentQuestionBase(models.Model):
    '''
    A base model for all types of student questions.

    ATTENTION! Trying to create an object of this model directly will raise an exception, as it's not intended to be used this way, create an object of one of the children instead!

    This model holds all common information for all types of questions, such as the question string.
    This is to hold all questions in one database, so that we can do more complicated things like rating, ordering or other.

    Additionally child models can be accessed though this one, by calling StudentQuestionBase.childmodelname (note the small case),
    but it might raise a DoesNotExist exception. To avoid this we have a question_type, which should correspond to one of QuestionTypes.
    To see an example please refer to matching/tests.py StudentQuestionTestCase.test_models().

    This database isn't be abstract, as it would make querying and other related code more complicated.
    However, it would be more efficient that way as we wouldn't have a single huge table for all questions with additional tables for extra fields for each question type.

    The student question should be related to a company question via a foregin key, for now it is optional.

    Necessary fields:
        question (string)       - the question
        question_type (string)  - special field that should always correspond to the type of the related questiontype (a child of this model), and as such should not be written to directly
        survey (m2m)            - many-2-many field to Surveys, that use this question
