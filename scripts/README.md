The Scripts folder is an artifact of ignorance.

It was used in place of manage.py commands (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/howto/custom-management-commands/), because we were not aware of that option.

Please use manage.py commands instead of such scripts in the future, as they are easier to use and list as well as providing some additional functionality!
