The Fair app is responsible for creating and managing a "fair" object in the database.

The "fair" is the annual Armada career fair, where companies present themselves at KTH and talk to the students.

This application has minimal functionality, but the fair model is a very important one, as it serves as the unifying identifier for the majority of other models in the whole ais application.
